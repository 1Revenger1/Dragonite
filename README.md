# Dragonite
Dragonite is a Discord bot that will have many functions such as playing music, moderation, and more.

If you are interested in using this bot, there are several things you need to do.
You'll need to create another file with three 'exports' that have the tokens returned within them.
This was done so I wouldn't mess up with accidently uploading tokens and so that it allows for easier access if need be.
You may also want to change a few things like the Games being played, which are seen around lines 20 - 30.

Current Version: 0.6.3
